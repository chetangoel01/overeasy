# Share-link compatibility

## Purpose and user-visible behavior

Sharing a recipe video to Overeasy now works when the source puts its URL in
the share item's attributed text instead of a URL or plain-text attachment.
The backend also accepts Instagram's `/share/reel/` URL shape and TikTok's
`/t/` redirect shape, then stores the same stable canonical source identity as
their direct-link equivalents.

Malformed links, non-HTTP(S) links, and unsupported hosts remain rejected.

## Decisions and affected components

- `LadleShare/ShareURLExtractor.swift` checks each extension item's attributed
  text before its attachments. Existing URL and plain-text handling is
  unchanged.
- `Backend/ladle/imports/source_identity.py` normalizes Instagram's extra
  `/share` path component and sends TikTok `/t/` links through the existing
  DNS-pinned redirect resolver.
- No new dependency, URL abstraction, or client-side platform parser was
  added. The backend remains the source of truth for social URL identity.

## Verification

- The new Share Extension regression first failed with no extracted URL, then
  passed with the attributed-text fallback.
- The new Instagram and TikTok parser regressions first failed as invalid URL
  shapes, then passed after normalization and safe redirect routing.
- Existing unsupported-scheme, missing-URL, direct URL, plain-text, social
  identity, and unsafe-host cases continue to pass.
- The complete Ladle test target passed on the iPhone 17 simulator. A Release
  simulator build passed and contains the embedded `LadleShare.appex`.
- The current non-live/non-chaos backend suite passed: 508 passed, 3 skipped,
  and 2 credential-dependent tests deselected. Ruff, Compose rendering, and
  `git diff --check` also passed.
